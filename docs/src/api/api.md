## Algorithm Selection Guide

| Data Type | Recommended Algorithm | Notes |
|-----------|----------------------|-------|
| Linear relationship | `LinearCurveFitAlgorithm()` | Fast, exact solution |
| Polynomial | `PolynomialFitAlgorithm(n)` | Specify degree `n` |
| Exponential growth/decay | `ExpCurveFitAlgorithm()` | Handles `y = a*exp(b*x)` |
| Logarithmic | `LogCurveFitAlgorithm()` | For `y = a*log(x) + b` |
| Power law | `PowerCurveFitAlgorithm()` | For `y = a*x^b` |
| Rational functions | `RationalPolynomialFitAlgorithm(m,n)` | Degrees m (num), n (den) |
| Multi-exponential | `ExpSumFitAlgorithm(n)` | Sum of n exponentials |
| Custom nonlinear | `NonlinearCurveFitProblem` | Full flexibility |

## Performance Tips

1. **Linear problems**: Always use `LinearCurveFitAlgorithm` when applicable
2. **Polynomial fitting**: Use orthogonal polynomials for numerical stability
3. **Initial guesses**: For nonlinear problems, good initial parameters are crucial
4. **Data scaling**: Normalize data to similar magnitudes before fitting

## Examples

### Basic Linear Fit

```julia
prob = CurveFitProblem(x, y, LinearCurveFitAlgorithm())
sol = solve(prob)
```

### Polynomial with Specific Degree

```julia
prob = CurveFitProblem(x, y, PolynomialFitAlgorithm(3))  # Cubic
sol = solve(prob)
```

### Custom Nonlinear Model

```julia
model(x, p) = @. p[1] * (1 - exp(-p[2] * x))
prob = NonlinearCurveFitProblem(model, x, y, p0)
sol = solve(prob)
```
